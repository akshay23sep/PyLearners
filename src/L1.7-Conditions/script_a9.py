#####################Conditions#################
####Python uses boolean variables to identofy the conditions. The boolean values True or False are returned when expression is evaluated or compared.###

###### IS operator

x 	=[10,20,30,40,50]
y 	=[10,20,30,40,50]
print (x==y)
print (x is y)

### The difference between IS and == operator is that IS operator compares both Left hand side and Right hand side while == compares only the Right hand side.
