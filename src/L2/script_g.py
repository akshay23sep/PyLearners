############   Variables and Types ##################"
############# In python you do not need to declare variables before using them, or declaring there type, since Python is object oriented. We should keep in mind that in Python each variable is an object.

################Operators on  Strings ###########
one = 1
two = 2
three = one + two
print (three)

################Another Example ###########
keep = "keep learning"
python = "python"
keep_learning_python = keep + " "   + python 
print(keep_learning_python)

################Another Example ###########
hello = "hello"
world = "world"
hello_world = hello + " " + world
print(hell_oworld)
