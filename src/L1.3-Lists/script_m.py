####################### Lists in Python#########
## Lists are very similar to arrays they contain any type of variable and also they can be itterated over a very simple manner.##

We want to add numbers and strings to connect the list using append. We must add numbers 100,150,200 to number list and words "hey" and "there" to strings available.

strings = []
numbers = []
names = ["Thomas", "Phillippe", "Jean"]
numbers.append(100)
numbers.append(150)
numbers.append(200)
strings.append("hey")
strings.append("there")
Last_name = names [2]
print(numbers)
print(strings)
print("The last name on the list is %s" % Last_name)
